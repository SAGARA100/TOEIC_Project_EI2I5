# TOEIC_Project_EI2I5
The goal of this project is to create a maze that a particular person can clear if he answers the questions correctly. 
This maze is made up of multiple rooms, and multiple section (a section is multiple rooms separated by a wall where the person traversing the maze is challenged). 
Multiple images will be displayed on the maze to simulate a virtual environment of our choosing.
Each room simulate a different environment, while each section gives different type of questions. 
While advancing, the player will be confronted with obstacles, to breach them, the player will have to answer the questions correctly. 
After doing so the player can advance to the next section.
